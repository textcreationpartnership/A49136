            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS one of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> however amongst the meanest, who have a title to that Stile, I cannot but be concern'd to read, what I am made to speak in <hi>Vox Cleri;</hi> and, as a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> I utterly disown it <hi>for my self,</hi> and I question not, but there are <hi>thousands of us</hi> who do the same: It is neither <hi>my sense</hi> nor <hi>language</hi> what is imposed on us under <hi>that Stile,</hi> and I cannot therefore, but with the greatest abhorrence, publish <hi>my protest</hi> against it. For what is it <hi>the Author</hi> thereof would have the World to judge of us, but that we are <hi>a Set of men</hi> who have very <hi>little tenderness</hi> for our <hi>weaker Brethren;</hi> very <hi>little zeal</hi> for <hi>his Service,</hi> who hath called us to our <hi>high imployment;</hi> very <hi>little concern</hi> for the <hi>publick peace of Church and State;</hi> if having such an <hi>opportunity</hi> put into our hands, as is now before us, and, as 'twere, the <hi>previons assurance</hi> of the <hi>concurrence of the whole</hi> Nation (as now assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) to confirm what <hi>we doe;</hi> shall think fit <hi>to do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at all at <hi>such a time,</hi> as <hi>this is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, I tremble to consider, what in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood will be the issue of such a <hi>Laodicean Temper;</hi> I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think, what 'tis for God <hi>to spue</hi> a Church <hi>out of his mouth,</hi> and what 'tis (the <hi>very temper</hi> certainly, that with respect to these things, seems to be too much among some of us,) that will provoke him to give up <hi>a people</hi> to <hi>such a Judgment!</hi> for so 'tis exprest, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. <hi>I know thy works that thou art neither hot nor cold: So then because thou art Lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth: because thou sayest I am rich
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101087:3"/>and increased with goods and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, poor and blind, and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For may not this be our case, as we consider <hi>our consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> and compare it, with what <hi>other Churches</hi> may come short <hi>of it,</hi> that by a false way of reasoning from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference we thus assume, we thence conclude, that <hi>there is nothing wanting to us,</hi> to need upon every Capricio to submit to <hi>change and alteration.</hi> For 'tis not as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our selves with <hi>one another,</hi> but as we come up to the <hi>Rule;</hi> that's <hi>common to all:</hi> 'Tis not our being the best <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Church in the world,</hi> not our thinking so of our selves, or others thinking, or speaking so of us, if there be still a greater <hi>purity and simplicity</hi> of the Gospel, than we can hitherto pretend to: Is the <hi>holiest man</hi> on the earth in such an happy State, that with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he should have no need to declare, <hi>that he hath not already attain'd, nor were already perfect, but that he it still to follow after if that he may apprehend that, for which he also is apprehended of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: that forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, he may press toward the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</hi> Or whatever <hi>is humane,</hi> be it in <hi>persons or publick bodies,</hi> can it pretend to be beyond any amendment.</p>
            <p>I would not detract <hi>from our Constitution,</hi> but why must we give it more, than the <hi>Authors</hi> of it (the <hi>first Reformers</hi> I mean) themselves thought to belong to it. For do not they speak of it? as <hi>what upon just causes, may be altered, and changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to speak truth, what was <hi>it self</hi> in its <hi>first Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but <hi>an alteration?</hi> a <hi>great and happy change</hi> from what was so <hi>full of Corruptions,</hi> as the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> and all <hi>its Offices</hi> are. We need go no farther to be satisfied herein, than to what themselves have so fully declared under those two Heads, <hi>viz. concerning the Service of the Church,</hi> and <hi>of Ceremonies why some be abolished and some retain'd,</hi> in which 'tis manifest that they have so justified what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have herein done, as to leave the <hi>same Rule</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to proceed by in like cases, <hi>according as they shall think best to the setting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the reducing the people to a most perfect, and godly living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101087:3"/>Errour, and Superstition;</hi> Nor do our <hi>late Reformers,</hi> those I mean, who in 1661 made the <hi>Alterations in the Liturgie,</hi> speak otherwise in their <hi>Preface to it,</hi> their words are these, <hi>viz. It is but reasonable, that upon weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Considerations, according to the various exigency of times and occasions, such changes and alterations should be made therein, as to those that are in place of Authority should from time to time seem either Necessary or Expedient.</hi> And if <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> or <hi>Expedience</hi> now require it, and <hi>to those in place of Authority</hi> it seems so, why there should not be <hi>a farther alteration,</hi> let any man give the Reason.</p>
            <p>But no reason can be given against it; None First, from the word of God, for that requires that we <hi>still press on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark of our high calling.</hi> None Secondly, From <hi>the Rubrick,</hi> for that supposes, and even dictates it. None Thirdly, From the <hi>Constitution of the Church,</hi> as now 'tis establisht, for that is founded on it. None Fourthly, From the <hi>Laws of the Nation,</hi> for they <hi>are humane,</hi> and may be <hi>altered or changed,</hi> it is <hi>one of the great fundamentals of our Government;</hi> the End, and business of <hi>our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to deliberate hereon. And Fifthly, For the <hi>dictates of mens private Consciences herein,</hi> their being <hi>bound by,</hi> or <hi>to the former Constitution,</hi> their <hi>Oaths or Subscriptions</hi> therein <hi>required,</hi> or <hi>given,</hi> 'tis very weak to argue from thence. <hi>All these</hi> falling of themselves, if the <hi>Constitution be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and it hath spoken it self to be such, for so 'tis decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>the Preface to the Liturgy,</hi> that the <hi>particular Forms of Divine worship, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be used therein, being in their own nature indifferent, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and so acknowledged, it is but reasonable; that upon weighty and importunt Considerations, according to the various exigency of times and occasions, such changes and alterations should be made therein, as to those that are in place of Authority should from time to time seem either Necessary, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient:</hi> And if so, then can no <hi>assent or consent,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>other tye</hi> we are under, obtain any longer, than whilst <hi>'tis in Force;</hi> it being only to the <hi>use of those</hi> things, as <hi>things that are in their own nature indifferent</hi> and <hi>alterable,</hi> and <hi>so acknowledged,</hi> we are thereby obliged; the consequence whereof is, that whenever they shall be <hi>lawfully altered,</hi> they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101087:4"/>may be as <hi>lawfully</hi> laid aside, and for the stinging Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as the Author imagins with which he hath taken his farwel of <hi>the two Authors of those Letters for Alterations,</hi> on which he makes his Remark, as being men whom he would <hi>not believe, should they swear to what they have said, because by what is matter of fact, such men have acted contrary to their Oaths, and Solemn Subscriptions,</hi> I doubt when it shall be seriously considered, He will be found to <hi>fight as much like Don Quixot, with windmils disturbing his brain,</hi> but much more to act like the <hi>Fur Predestinatus</hi> under a <hi>fatal necessity,</hi> the quaint Comparison under which he expresses his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of those he reflects on, as <hi>either of</hi> them; For were it not too much favouring of his own Levity, his Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might be a little further improved, and instead of <hi>Fur Predistinatus, Lunatick,</hi> be supplied, and would exactly express this Case: For as there is nothing more usual than to see those poor wretches, after they are once master'd, bound, or chain'd by their Keepers, never after to resist them again, tho but seemingly bound with the <hi>weakest threads and straws:</hi> So because one under the <hi>powerful Bonds</hi> of <hi>Oaths and Subscriptions,</hi> tho the <hi>binding force</hi> be taken away; And those who have the power to set <hi>free,</hi> shall take off the <hi>restraint, and infranchise the Conscience,</hi> as to any <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obligation;</hi> yet the <hi>distempered fancy</hi> shall still hold the man <hi>in bondage,</hi> and make him think himself as much <hi>bound,</hi> as when <hi>those</hi> were in greatest force.</p>
            <p>That 'tis farther declared in the <hi>preface to the Liturgy,</hi> by them who made the <hi>Alterations in</hi> 1661: <hi>We are fully perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our judgments, that the book as it stood before established by Law, doth not contain any thing contrary to the word of God, or to sound Doctrine, or which a godly man may not with a good Conscience use and submit unto or which is not fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencible against any that shall oppose the same;</hi> This is as <hi>high a Testimony,</hi> as can well be given of any thing that <hi>is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> and Supposes <hi>the Obligations</hi> under which men were <hi>to use it,</hi> as reasonable, as what have been since in force; And yet they doubted not to make <hi>Alterations in it, And who of the Church</hi> ever hath blamed them for so doing? Had it not been agreable to the <hi>Oaths and Subscriptions</hi> before made, how came they to yield to such a change, how came
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101087:4"/>they <hi>willingly, and of their own accord,</hi> they use their own words, <hi>to assent to such Alterations?</hi> Nor did <hi>they</hi> consider by <hi>what Persons, what the pretence, or to what purpose they might be tender'd to them, but only the Necessity, and Expedience</hi> of what they did: Whatever the <hi>End of others</hi> was, <hi>their aim was to do that which in their best understandings they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived might most tend to the preservation of Peace and Unity in the Church; the procuring of Reverence, and exciting of Piety, and Devotion in the publick worship of God; and the cutting off occasion from them that seek occasion of Cavil, or quarrel against the Liturgy of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>same Ends</hi> may be still any farther advanced, what is it should hinder the <hi>happy progresse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as with respect <hi>to those who made the Alterations,</hi> so with respect to <hi>others;</hi> How come <hi>so many of them,</hi> who were then living, and had given their <hi>approbation</hi> to the <hi>Former book,</hi> nay in the times of truth had many of them been little less then <hi>Confessors and Martyrs for it,</hi> and called <hi>themselves</hi> in distinction from others, <hi>the Church of England, as conforming to it, to Receive, Substract, and give their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and consent to this?</hi> Or how came so many <hi>worthy men</hi> afterwards, <hi>Men,</hi> who were able enough to have consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what was <hi>Lawful,</hi> what <hi>unlawful,</hi> what <hi>consistent with a good Conscience,</hi> what could not be done but <hi>with a bad one,</hi> to submit to it.</p>
            <p>And why now upon the same grounds, <hi>If necessity or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience</hi> call for it, <hi>and those in place of Authority</hi> see good, may not it bear a new and more correct Edition still.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pudet haec opprobria vobis,</hi> which the Author layes so great stress on, as if <hi>thereby we confest the manner of our publick worship were so corrupt, that we were ashamed of it, and were convinced of a Necessity to purge,</hi> is the most trifling thing a <hi>Man of Sense,</hi> much more a <hi>Man of Conscience,</hi> should be affrighted at. For 'tis not whether we are ashamed of it, or no: No we think we justly magnifie it, as the <hi>best Constitution</hi> any <hi>Establisht Church enjoys:</hi> But 'tis <hi>whether any thing</hi> that is <hi>better,</hi> may be yet thought on; and if so, then I am sure, <hi>Pudet haec opprobria vobis,</hi> &amp;c. will too nearly concern us; and 'twill be the <hi>highest shame, and reproach to reason, and Conscience too,</hi> if we shew not our <hi>zeal for it: To be Divines</hi> is to be persons,

               <hi>My Brethren</hi> these are things, that do <hi>require something from us;</hi> these are <hi>things that have a voice</hi> and will be heard one time, or other, either <hi>at Mans, or Gods Tribunal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say <hi>none requires it, when the Nation</hi> hath been so long in a <hi>Ferment</hi> about these things:</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101087:5"/>
            <p> When a <hi>Civil war</hi> hath already been kindled for is at least this made one of the great <hi>Pretences of mens dissatisfaction:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could say more, the Expectation of those glorious times, which are still behind for the Church of Christ, <hi>when the Earth shall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea, Isaiah</hi> 11.9. For then as it is in the next preceding words, <hi>they shall not hurt, nor destroy in all my holy mountain:</hi> There will be then no <hi>more Schisms or Divisions, no quarrels</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly about things, that on all sides are own'd to be <hi>altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> no breach of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> to lead on to that <hi>Ruine and Destruction,</hi> which only the want of the <hi>knowledge of the Lord</hi> can bring upon <hi>a Church or People:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, things in the world being as they are upon <hi>the Wheel,</hi> and all tending to some <hi>great change, and Alteration in Religion</hi> as well as in the <hi>several states of men,</hi> have these <hi>no voice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not worth our while to consider a little, <hi>what God is doing</hi> in the world, and bethink our selves whether there be not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in which it imports us yet further to purge our selves before <hi>he who hath his Fan in his hand do it so,</hi> as to leave us among that <hi>Chafe, which shall be burnt up with unquenchable fire,</hi> Matth. 3.11. Who can tell, as 'tis in the foregoing verse, whether the <hi>Ax be not laid to the root of the Tree,</hi> 'Tis what those, who are most zealous <hi>against alteration,</hi> seem most to fear. <hi>And is there no fruit,</hi> we are upon such a warning <hi>to bring forth,</hi> that it may <hi>not be hewn down, and cast into the fire.</hi>

               <hi>ut teipsum Serves, non expergiscere?</hi> can we imagin 'tis for nothing that God hath so long <hi>had a Controversie with us;</hi> that we would so sleightly heal the hurt of the Daugher of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let us, O sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> betake our selves to our <hi>Urim, and Thummim, and Enquire of the Lord, what that accurs'd thing</hi> is, that is among us; We cannot want a full direction if we take this method; For the <hi>Book</hi> that was put <hi>into our hands,</hi> when we entred <hi>into Holy Orders,</hi> is that <hi>Urim and Thummim;</hi> there's the <hi>clearest light, there the Rule of Perfection,</hi> by which whilst we guid our selves, we cannot <hi>err: Our Bible</hi> that will tell us, that no <hi>judgment</hi> ever came upon a <hi>Church or People but for some sin;</hi> that there is no <hi>judgment</hi> but may be removed by <hi>Repentance, and Reformation;</hi> I would not put too great a stress upon the matter, but is it not likely that the want of <hi>tenderness, and compassion for our weaker Brethren,</hi> (if that should chance to be at the bottom) <hi>the want of any thing of that love which our</hi> good Lord <hi>hath made, the distinguishing character of his Disciples, John</hi>

            <p>Only herein I must not be <hi>so undutiful, so unnatural</hi> to my <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of England,</hi> as to charge all the blame at her door, I dare not so much as insinuate that, only 'twill become her, when she sees the danger her Children are in with her, to be so natural to consider what in all probability may be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it, and what she can do to remove it.</p>
            <p>And here I would apply to those, who have been still too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>to overtake her between the straits,</hi> Lament. 1.3.

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>The Alarm God hath so lately given us, in that <hi>dreadfull tempestuous Wind,</hi> that was so terrible at <hi>Land and Sea,</hi> doth it not tell us, that he that suffer'd it to make but some <hi>slight impressions</hi> on <hi>our Houses,</hi> could as easily have <hi>overturn'd all,</hi> and <hi>buried us in the Ruines,</hi> he that scattered only <hi>some of our Ships,</hi> and as we hope (for the full account of the loss is not yet known) suffer'd <hi>only some of them to founder,</hi> can when he please, <hi>break them all,</hi> as he did <hi>Jehosaphats Ezion-geber,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.36, 37.</p>

Or in the usual Allusion to <hi>pull down the Old House,</hi> before care is taken to lay the <hi>Foundation for a New one?</hi> Which instead of <hi>repairing,</hi> is but to make <hi>the greater Ruin;</hi> instead of raising <hi>a New Fabrick,</hi> is but to make <hi>our dwelling a place,</hi> as 'tis exprest <hi>Lament.</hi> 5.18. <hi>for the Foxes to walk on, &amp;c. to tread down, and insult over us,</hi> when we shall have laid open our <hi>own weakness,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of inviting others <hi>to shelter themselves with us,</hi> have put our selves out of a Capacity to defend <hi>either them, or our selves?</hi> Or how are we sure, that what we shall do herein, <hi>will ingage those,</hi> to whom we pretend <hi>this great Tenderness,</hi> to <hi>joyn with us?</hi> How can we tell, whether one Concession may not only make way for another? and that at last all must be given up to quiet them, who neither, should we do that, can we assure our selves, they should be contented?</p>
            <p>I confess thus <hi>Carnal interest</hi> would argue, thus <hi>those,</hi> who <hi>live by sense,</hi> and <hi>not by faith</hi> will press us with their reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And had <hi>we an Eye</hi> that lookt no farther <hi>than sense;</hi> this might be too apt to prevail. But do we but considen what we ought to do <hi>as Christians,</hi> as <hi>men of Faith,</hi> more than <hi>Reason,</hi> and all this will vanish.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101087:9"/>
            <p> For <hi>who is it,</hi> to <hi>whom we</hi> profess to have devoted our selves? Whose <hi>work is</hi> it, we are upon? For <hi>whose sake is</hi> it, we shall do, what is expected? Is it not the <hi>Glory of God, the Honour of Christ,</hi> and <hi>the good of his Church,</hi> we have in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? And are we afraid, <hi>He</hi> will not <hi>defend</hi> us, whilst we <hi>act in his Cause?</hi> Are we afraid of the <hi>Policies of Crafty men,</hi> whilst 'tis this <hi>wonderful Counsellor,</hi> whose dictates we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to attend? Are we afraid, (we must renounce <hi>our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> and <hi>disclaim our selves</hi> to be his <hi>Clergy, his Lot,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> if we entertain so mean a thought) he will not be <hi>true to himself, and his promises</hi> to his Church? Can the <hi>Gates of Hell prevail against it,</hi> whilst <hi>the Rock of Ages, is</hi> he, on whom we depend? Be we but satisfied, that what we do, is <hi>with Integrity,</hi> is <hi>with submission to the guidance of his Holy Spirit,</hi> is with <hi>that self denial</hi> as to resign up all <hi>to his Will;</hi> and can we question, whether <hi>He can,</hi> or <hi>will herein</hi> defend us?</p>
            <p>Remember my Brethren, what is said <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall any man desire thy Land, when thou shalt go up to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.</hi> Enemies enough lay about the <hi>Jews,</hi> all the world were in a manner such to them; And what <hi>a Temptation</hi> must it be to them, when the <hi>Land was left Naked,</hi> to make their <hi>inroads into it?</hi> But see what was <hi>their Bulwork, what the Walls of their Salvation;</hi> 'twas the assurance <hi>of Gods Providence</hi> watching over them.</p>
            <p>For <hi>their Sins,</hi> their Neighbours often <hi>desired their Land,</hi> and <hi>brought them</hi> under; <hi>led them into Captivity,</hi> and <hi>destroy'd their City,</hi> and <hi>Temple it self;</hi> But <hi>their going up</hi> to it, and <hi>Worshipping</hi> God as they ought there, never gave their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies an advantage against them: No, <hi>Gods Service,</hi> whilst they continued true to it, as it is <hi>in our Liturgy,</hi> was <hi>perfect freedom;</hi> that which would always have kept them in the full <hi>enjoyment of their Liberties;</hi> had they not <hi>enslaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to,</hi> and <hi>by their Transgressions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can we Christians doubt the same security, if we do our Duty. I could shew how in all the Revolutions of that Nation, when they <hi>put their trust in men,</hi> made <hi>the Arm of Flesh then Confidence,</hi> they <hi>were still Defeated;</hi> whereas when they <hi>made God their Refuge,</hi> as in the Case of <hi>their Judges, of David, of Jehosaphat, of Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>always Success, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Prosperity</hi> went along with them; and with respect to mens acting <hi>their Faith on God, whilst in his ways,</hi> 'tis laid down as a standing Reason of the Churches confidence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101087:9"/>Mulachi. 3.6. <hi>for I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye Sons of Jacob are nor consumed,</hi> therefore <hi>none</hi> can be <hi>consumed, who trust in him</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he wrought <hi>Miracles for the Isrealites,</hi> were <hi>we</hi> sure to be reduced to the same Extremities, cannot he <hi>do the same</hi> for us? If not, why hath <hi>our Lord</hi> left it upon record, <hi>that if our Faith be but as a grain of Mustard-Seed, we shall say to this mountain be thou removed hence to yonder place, and it shall be removed, and nothing shall be unpossible to us,</hi> Matth. 17.20.</p>
            <p>Be our <hi>enemies</hi> ever so <hi>watchful,</hi> ever so powerful, have we not a good Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity against them. Prov. 16.7. <hi>When a mans ways please the Lord he maketh even his Enemies to be at Peace with him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can tell, but the <hi>Candor, and Ingenuity, the Honesty, and Sincerity,</hi> with which we act, may so far prevail <hi>with those,</hi> who <hi>wait for our halting</hi> that as 'tis 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. <hi>They may fall down, and worship God with us, and say God is in you of a Truth?</hi> there's no such way to perswade men, as this, to let them see, how intirely we <hi>follow God;</hi> How willing we are to <hi>sacrifice</hi> all we can <hi>to Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worth our considering, what inprobability, ever since we have been a Church, I mean a <hi>national, Protestant Church,</hi> hath been the reason, we have had <hi>Enemies on hoth hands, from</hi> Rome, <hi>and at home?</hi> And whether the Comment on it be not that of <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counsel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich, and white rayment, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be cloathed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine Eyes with Eye salve, that thou mayest see?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May not it be to <hi>open our eyes</hi> at length, that we have had so many <hi>Tryals from God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What were the <hi>many Controversies, that upon the Refermation</hi> presently succeeded <hi>among our selves,</hi> but to mind us still of a <hi>further Reformation;</hi> and if after the disputes with those zealous Brethren (I defend not <hi>their mistakes,</hi> I only observe <hi>their Pretences</hi>) things grew <hi>still worse and worse, till a civil war was brought into our Bowels, the Head of our Church, and the first Pillar of it Sacrificed in the cause, and the Church it self</hi> devested of <hi>all its outward Advantages,</hi> and only <hi>a remnant</hi> left, that were driven <hi>into Corners,</hi> what can this signifie, <hi>but some lesson,</hi> that God was teaching us by such a rod? I pray God, we may at length take it out as we ought; and if the <hi>same Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> which had thus exercised the Nation, <hi>brought back our Captivity,</hi> settled the <hi>Son of that Marcyr'd Prince,</hi> upon <hi>his Fathers throne,</hi> brought him <hi>in with that Glory, those acclamations</hi> that never <hi>Prince</hi> before appear'd with in this Nation, restored <hi>the Hierarchy, and raised the Church to its former glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Is it not worth our considering, that as the <hi>great Tryal of King and People, those,</hi> who had been <hi>punisht for their sins,</hi> there were <hi>new offers of a Reformation,</hi> and in Part that was made? Whether it proceeded as far, as it should, <hi>God best knows, and under him,</hi> that is, what is now offer'd to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101087:10"/>your Enquiry; And 'tis upon <hi>a Revolution extraordinary and Miraculous,</hi> as that of the return of <hi>Charles the Second</hi> was, that this is again proposed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reject it</hi> not my Brethren, <hi>reject it</hi> not, as you your selves would <hi>not be rejected of God:</hi> For I perswade my self we are <hi>under the Crisis,</hi> and if we put from us <hi>this day of Salvation;</hi> If <hi>when</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven is so nigb at hand,</hi> we <hi>refuse to repent,</hi> Mat. 3.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> to change our minds as to those <hi>rigorous impositions</hi> (so some will call them) that we would <hi>still retain,</hi> we have reason to fear, as it is, v. 10. <hi>That the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree,</hi> (I would not be an ill Prophet, but if this should be, men will then severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough reflect on what they have been <hi>Warned of,</hi> but <hi>have neglected</hi>) <hi>and that every Tree, that bringeth not forth good Fruit, shall be hewn down, and cast into the Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider 'twas <hi>the doom of the best Church,</hi> that ever was in the World, upon their <hi>refusing to reform,</hi> you have it <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. <hi>Therefore I say unto you,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Fruit thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We of the Gentiles,</hi> who enjoy the Gospel, reap the <hi>benefit</hi> of their doom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We of this Nation,</hi> above all the world, let it not be <hi>our doom</hi> to have <hi>the Kingdom of God likewise taken from us,</hi> and <hi>given to others bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is an Exhortation, might be heard, were we <hi>sure</hi> those <hi>whom we are willing to open the doors of the Church to, would come in:</hi> But alas, what we can give them will only <hi>expose the Church,</hi> and <hi>not reclaim them:</hi> Why then should <hi>we not rest, where we are?</hi> why not <hi>defend the spot,</hi> that they have so <hi>envious an eye upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pardon me, my Brethren, if I say 'tis weak, and unworthy of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> thus to argue: <hi>Those</hi> who <hi>are men of Conscience,</hi> will not <hi>seek new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of quarrell,</hi> where, what is <hi>Christian-like</hi> is done <hi>by us; those</hi> who are <hi>men of no Conscience,</hi> would be glad to ruin <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>are we sure our labour is lost?</hi> I say, morally speaking, we are <hi>sure of the contrary;</hi> there's none of us, who live in <hi>Parishes,</hi> and are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our <hi>respective Flocks,</hi> but we know, that there <hi>are some,</hi> who would be <hi>contented,</hi> and think it <hi>a great Blessing to be eased in those things,</hi> which I perswade my self, with <hi>a good Conscience</hi> may be <hi>yielded to them: And he that converteth a Sinner from the Error of his way, shall save a Soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins,</hi> James, 5.20.</p>
            <p>Were they but <hi>single Souls</hi> we should hereby gain, 'tis <hi>worth our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discension,</hi> 'tis what will <hi>increase our glory,</hi> and make <hi>us shine as brighter Stars for ever, and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3.</p>
            <p>But certainly we have <hi>reason to hope, the success will be greater;</hi> nay we have no reason <hi>to doubt it;</hi> for what is it, will win upon men, if not that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101087:10"/>
               <hi>real concern,</hi> they shall find we have <hi>for their Souls,</hi> when we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>their peace</hi> before any <hi>temporal interest of our own?</hi> For me-thinks, I would not <hi>have that</hi> have any ingrediency in this matter; <hi>you</hi> very well know, what <hi>Schisms, their being carnal,</hi> and <hi>acting as men,</hi> made in <hi>the Church of Corinth,</hi> 1 Corinth. 3.3. <hi>Ye</hi> very well know, how 'tis this, that hath carried on all <hi>the corruptions of Rome;</hi> ye very well know, 'tis to deny your selves to be <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Disciples,</hi> (were even that the case) not to take <hi>up your Cross, and follow him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what did I say <hi>the Cross?</hi> Is it not to follow him, that will make, as 'tis <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 58.8, 9. <hi>Our light to break forth as the morning,</hi> our health to spring forth speedily, our Righteousness shall go before us, and the Glory of the <hi>Lord shall be our reward: Then shall we call, and the Lord shall answer, we shall cry, and he shall say here I am; if we take away from the midst of us the Yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and the speaking Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ver. 10. And if <hi>we draw out our Soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted Soul, then shall our light rise in Obscurity, and our darkness</hi> be as the noon day, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And the Lord shall <hi>guide us continually, and satisfie our Soul in drought, and make full our bones, and we shall be like a Water-garden, and like a spring of Water, whose waters fail not,</hi> v. 12. <hi>And they that be of us shall build the old waste places, we shall raise up the foundations of many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and we shall be call'd the repairers of the breach, the restorers of Paths to dwell in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what now can be the result of all, but that considering <hi>these and those other Reasons</hi> you are able to suggest to your selves <hi>for the Alterations,</hi> that are here pleaded for, <hi>you take the same course</hi> in <hi>your debatings, which the Apostles</hi> did in the <hi>first solemn Council at</hi> Jerusalem. And that is to be sure <hi>to preface all you shall determine</hi> with <hi>it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us</hi> Acts 15.22. and in the resolution of what ye shall decree <hi>to lay upon jour selves, and your Brethren no more than necessary things,</hi> v. 28. And if that be the measure of what ye shall do, ye will have reason to hope, <hi>it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> as <hi>their decree was,</hi> i. e. so as to end <hi>in their rejoycing for the Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> v. 31.</p>
            <p>'Twill be a very <hi>unhappy Omen</hi> upon your proceedings, (and therefore in the <hi>Name of God, the God of peace and comfort,</hi> take heed above all things of those <hi>Heats and Animosities,</hi> which some will be ant enough to provoke you to) <hi>if ye,</hi> who are met upon such <hi>weighty things,</hi> as what concerns the <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Religion,</hi> the <hi>very simplicity of the Gospel,</hi> shall at your <hi>very entrance</hi> on the <hi>great Work,</hi> chase away <hi>that good spirit,</hi> by whom alone ye can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be <hi>rightly directed in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not reflect on any thing, which hath been said by any of <hi>that Venerable Assembly</hi> you make; only I cannot but observe the great mistake of that applauded saying, <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mutare,</hi> the highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101087:11"/>imaginable to our Constitution; for he who saith so, hath at once <hi>dissolved the Fundamentals of Church and State;</hi> for why else do <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments meet?</hi> Why <hi>are Convocations</hi> Assembled, if the <hi>Rule</hi> be every where <hi>so perfect,</hi> that it can <hi>admit no change?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas certainly well resolved <hi>pro tempore,</hi> when that was agreed to be the present sense of the <hi>Barons,</hi> with respect to what was then, <hi>viz.</hi> proposed <hi>in the Legitimation of Bastardy to have past into a Law:</hi> But 'tis the same that is resolved in every thing <hi>in Parliament,</hi> to which <hi>either House doth not consent,</hi> and which is not <hi>continu'd by the Royal Authority:</hi> 'Tis <hi>Nolumus mutane le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Angliae, they see no present Reason to change what is proposed,</hi> but you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this to <hi>Religious Affairs,</hi> and that when the Honour of God, and the Peace of his Church are concern'd in the Change, is to forget how much more proper 'twould have been in the Mouth of a Clergy man, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus mutare leges Evangelii, Nolumus mutare leges Christi, Nolumus mutare legei Dei:</hi> Charity is the standing Law of all, <hi>the bearing with our weaker Brethren,</hi> the <hi>denying our selves,</hi> where Truth is in debate, (the Principle on which <hi>we were made Christians,</hi>) the only Proof we can give of our being of our <hi>great Masters Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any thing offer'd, that is not so agreeable <hi>to the Will of God,</hi> to the <hi>Rules of our Lord, to the Gospel we preach,</hi> and are we still fond to <hi>retain it:</hi> No, let us do as in the first Councils <hi>set the Holy Gospels in the Throne;</hi> let us <hi>revere those,</hi> as <hi>if Christ were</hi> present with us, and let us say only with respect to what is there deliver'd, <hi>Nolumus mu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
